** Data types

All objects in the exported JSON have a special data type property which indicates the type of data
they are supposed to represent. This is meant to make it easier for external tools to interpret. By
default this property is named ~"$$data_type"~ but its value can be customized with the
=:json-data-type-property= option (see the [[*Options][options]] section).

*** org-document
**** Properties
- =contents= (array of =org-node= objects) :: The top-level elements in the document. This should
     consist of an optional =section= node followed by any number of =header= nodes.

*** org-node
A node (element or object) in the document's parse tree.

See the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][Org element API documentation]] for the list of node types and their properties.

**** Properties
- =type= (string) ::
- =ref= (string) ::
- =contents= (array) ::
- =properties= (=mapping= object) ::

*** mapping
A mapping is just an association of strings to values without any specific structure. An
example is the properties of an =org-node= object.

*** error
- =message= (array) :: A message describing why the error occurred.

** Specific node types

** Node types with specific handling
*** org-data
*** headline
*** link
**** Additional properties
- =is-inline-image= (bool) :: Whether org mode think this link should be rendered as an inline
  image.
- =target-ref= (string) :: The =ref= property of the headline or other node this link resolves
  to, if applicable.
*** timestamp
**** Additional properties
- =start=, =end= (string) :: Year/month/day/hour/minute from the =start-*= and =end-*= sets of
  properties combined together and encoded as a single string in
  [[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime][ISO 8601]] format.
